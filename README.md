- As a User, I'd like the questions to be on topics I'm familiar with.
- As a User, when playing a trivia game, I dont want to answer too many questions, but just enough.

# Challenges

Some of the Challenges I had:

- The creative process; thinking of how I wanted the game to function
- CSS!! 
- Putting my thoughts of how the game should be and translating it to a code. 
 

# The Creative Process 

- I wanted to create a trivia game with question/answer options anyone could play.  
- I wanted to keep it simple and not over complicate what I wanted to accomplish. 
- Most importantly, I wanted to take this as an opportunity to apply what I have learned so far in my new found journey into coding, and come out of the making of this project with more knowledge and understanding of HTML/CSS/JavaScript/jQuery than I had going into the beginning of this process.  I look forward to learning new, exciting things and creating more projects. 


# Things I could add in the future 

- a button to auto reset game once completed
- different set of questions for player 2 to answer
- a timer
